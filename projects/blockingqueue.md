Blocking queues and message passing
=======

## Goal

Your goal in this project is to explore the use of blocking queues and message passing between producers and consumers or *actors*. You will build two blocking queues yourself, `SynchronizedBlockingQueue` and `RingBuffer`, then in another case you will use Java's `ArrayBlockingQueue`.

In order to test the efficiency of the blocking queues, you will also build a `ThreadObserver` that measures the ratio of time a thread spends block versus running.
